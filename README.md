# Balloon_problem

This project computes how many times every letter from the entered word (for example balloon) is contained in another string at least once.
String that we are traversing is read from the .txt file. After the process, the integer result is saved in another .txt file.
The code has various exceptions and unit tests.
Additionally, one Java class is implemented using HTTP request (doGet method) so it can be used in a webapp.
